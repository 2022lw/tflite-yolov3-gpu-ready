# YOLO v3 TensorFlow Lite iOS GPU acceleration

* This projects trains YOLO v3 model with [BDD100k Dataset](https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2018/05/30/bdd/)
* And you can convert the trained model into TFLite model that GPU acceleration ready for iOS!

# Training
Please refer to [python](https://github.com/JeiKeiLim/tflite-yolov3-gpu-ready/tree/master/python) directory of this repository.

# iOS Examples
You can find out [iOS](https://github.com/JeiKeiLim/tflite-yolov3-gpu-ready/tree/master/iOS) directory of this repository.

## 1. YOLO object detection example project
Please refer to [iOS/yolojk_iOS](https://github.com/JeiKeiLim/tflite-yolov3-gpu-ready/tree/master/iOS/yolojk_iOS) directory of this repository.

## 2. gonogono - Observing traffic signs and front car instead of the driver
Please refer to [iOS/gonogono](https://github.com/JeiKeiLim/tflite-yolov3-gpu-ready/tree/master/iOS/gonogono) directory of this repository.

# Future update
